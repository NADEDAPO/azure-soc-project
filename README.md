# Building an SOC & Honeynet in Azure 


![BMGCOLOR4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5aca205-e65c-4bc8-ae79-0b9dd07f6222)

## Introduction

For this project we are going to setup our Virtual Machines/Add Users in Active Directory. We will also set up our Log Analytics 
alongside our Sentinel to begin ingesting various malicious log data flowing into our SIEM using the traffic coming from our configured inbound 
rules. Next, we will trigger some alerts and incidents, and do some geo-mapping. Lastly we will run an insecure enviornment for 24 hours
and proceed to harden that envoirnment after those 24 hours using various security controls.



##

ðŸ›  **Requirements, Tools & Controls Implemented:**

- *Azure Virtual Network (Vnet)*
- *Azure Network Security Groups (NSG's/Firewall)*
- *(2) Windows VM's & (1) Linux Virtual Machine*
- *Log Analytics Workspace with Kusto Query Language (KQL) Queries*
- *Azure Key Vault Management*
